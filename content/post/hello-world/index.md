# The Revolution Begins now

> Life is controlled by those in charge, until the ones they control rise up against them.

This may make us out as the rebels, and in reality we are the rebels. We have our own licence, our own goals, and our own way forward. It is just not the way of the Corporation.

## Who are we?

> Where have we been all these years?

We are a collection of prolific and rebelious people, shadow banned in so many communites we had no choice but to come together and form a movement against the ones who did this too us.

## Why are we rebelling?

Because as we were once told, there are two ways of organizing a group of people, a Corporation, and a Cooperaation. We have decided that we have seen how Corporation works, and it is time to see what
is on the other side.
